# Alphabet program in the C programming language

When learning a new programming language I start with "Hello World!",
just like lots of other programmers.
My second program is most of the time, the program you are looking at right now.

The program is a kind of game where you have to type the alphabet as fast as you can.

## Motivation

Writing the alphabet program forces me to learn the basic concepts of a new language,
including I/O and sometimes some graphics.
It is simple enough to grasp, but complex enough to split the program in files, modules,
packages or whatever the new language supports.

## History

I wrote the same program in a lot of different languages, but most of this code is lost.
Versions were created in Java, different kinds of BASIC, Angular/TypeScript et cetera.
My C version on Unix from around 1985, that predates ANSI-C, was lost.

My second C program was actually a COBOL generator and no the alphabet game.

## Compiling and running the program

Since I'm on Linux, this program will only run on Linux.
Compile and execute it using:
```bash
gcc *.c -o alphabet
./alphabet
```

## Some technical information

For the first time I wrote a C program where AI suggested a lot of the code.
Sometimes creating an empty method was enough to get a complete implementation,
completely missing the intention of figuring things out myself.
Sometimes I had to turn AI off, to think for myself.

The code in the terminal.c file was particularly troublesome, since the terminal
by default works on a line-by-line basis.
